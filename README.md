# NLO QED Calculation of Pair Production Processes at Lepton Colliders

## Project Overview

This project focuses on next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations for pair production processes at lepton colliders. The objective is to improve the precision of theoretical predictions for these fundamental processes and ensure their relevance to experimental measurements.


## Introduction

Lepton colliders, such as the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and future projects like the International Linear Collider (ILC), provide unique opportunities to study fundamental particle interactions with high precision. This project aims to develop a rigorous theoretical framework and computational tools to perform NLO QED calculations for pair production processes at these colliders.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for NLO QED calculations.
- Implement numerical algorithms to evaluate NLO corrections to cross sections and differential distributions.
- Perform numerical analyses to account for higher-order radiative corrections.
- Validate theoretical predictions against experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Provide deeper insights into the dynamics of pair production processes and their implications for precision physics.
